*   Occasional double results in deal function if called manually while arbitrage is running
*   Allow sell percentage to be updated on the fly by IRC command
*   Make it so .bal function reflects pending withdrawals as unavailable cash immediately
*   Fix verication when deal shifts position in list but is still valid ([A, B, C] -> [A, D, B, C] where selected deal 'B' is still valid between calls)
*   Clean up deals IRC output so that it is readable
*   Make it so wallet addresses are handled gracefully in background (so we can do things like ".wdw bflr 0.5 mtgx" instead) 


*   Investigate:

    17:26:49 <  bitbot> AttributeError: 'PrivateBitfloor' object has no attribute 'timestamp' (file "/mnt/sdc1/ted/bitbot/modules/control.py", line 234, in sell)
